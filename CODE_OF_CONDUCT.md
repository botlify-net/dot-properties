# Botlify Open Source Community Guidelines

At Botlify, we recognize and celebrate the creativity and collaboration of open
source contributors and the diversity of skills, experiences, cultures, and
opinions they bring to the projects and communities they participate in.

Every one of Google's open source projects and communities are inclusive
environments, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities,
neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race,
age, religion, or similar personal characteristic.

We value diverse opinions, but we value respectful behavior more.

Respectful behavior includes:

* Being considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
* Not engaging in demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, sexualized, or
  physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
* Not engaging in unwanted physical contact.
